### üß™ NetCDF Validation
‚ú®**Add an `x` between the brackets to indicate basic testing was completed**
- [ ] Created a new working directory (e.g., `ILAMB-DATA/GFED5/`)
- [ ] Created a standalone python script that downloads and processes the new dataset (e.g., `ILAMB-DATA/GFED5/convert.py`)
    - [ ] The python script outputs a netcdf (e.g., `ILAMB-DATA/GFED5/burntFractionAll_mon_GFED5_199701-202012.nc`)
- [ ] Ran `python3 validate_dataset.py ILAMB-DATA/GFED5/burntFractionAll_mon_GFED5_199701-202012.nc` in command line and resolved any errors
- [ ] Visually inspected the outputted netCDF for obvious issues
    - [ ] `ncdump -h ILAMB-DATA/GFED5/burntFractionAll_mon_GFED5_199701-202012.nc` to visually inspect the netCDF header information
    - [ ] `ncview ILAMB-DATA/GFED5/burntFractionAll_mon_GFED5_199701-202012.nc` to visually inspect the map (where applicable)
